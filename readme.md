# Serverless Image Optimizer

Uses S3 & Lambda to take an image in `originals` folder in S3, and turns it into various sizes and optimized.

Allows you to drop in a raw file (png, jpg), and have it process (optimize & resize) into multiple outputs.

## Example
Input: 

`/originals/500x500_1000x1000/test.jpg`

Output:

- `/processed/500x500/test.jpg`
- `/processed/1000x1000/test.jpg`

## Instructions
Step 1: Install [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/)

Step 2: Setup IAM user with following policy (still trying to work out best for first 5):
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1482712489000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "apigateway:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "logs:*",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "lambda:CreateFunction",
                "lambda:InvokeAsync",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:DeleteFunction",
                "lambda:ListVersionsByFunction",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:UpdateAlias",
                "lambda:CreateAlias",
                "lambda:DeleteAlias",
                "lambda:PublishVersion",
                "lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration",
                "lambda:AddPermission",
                "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
                "lambda:GetLayerVersion",
                "cloudformation:ListStackResources",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStackResource",
                "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate",
                "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter",
                "logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:DeleteLogGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Step 3: Ensure to have your serverless [config set up](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/) so it can deploy to AWS

Step 4: You also need to make sure your bucket is configured for clients to set a public-accessible ACL by unticking these two boxes:
![S3 Properties](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSdVz.png) - might need to set the JSON policy for public too as when I upload, I had to change option to public image.

Step 5: Create an S3 bucket, with the folders `originals` and `processed` in it.

Step 6: Set the bucket name in the `serverless.yml`

Step 7: Node runtime is no longer bundled for nodejs10 and later so we need to provide an extra layer to our Lambda. I found [this Gitbub repository](https://github.com/serverlesspub/imagemagick-aws-lambda-2) which provides [a layer you can easily deploy](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:145266761615:applications~image-magick-lambda-layer). I just clicked the “Deploy” button, waited 5 minutes and I got a new private layer in my AWS account. Just update the `layers` in serverless.yml once done.

Step 8: Run the deployment commands below in `Deploy`.

Step 9: Add your files into S3 `/originals/` folder in the new bucket created. Note: you MUST use a sub folder for sizes (eg 500x500 or 500x500_1000x1000 folder with files in there).

The layer add the required libraries in /opt/bin. That is why we need to tell ImageMagic to look in that folder.

Step 10: Check CloudWatch Logs to see if there are any errors from the `index.js` file.

Step 11: Repeat until it's working and CloudWatch logs shows success (or that files exist... same same).

## Deploy
Run the following commands:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xxxxxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="yyyyyy"

docker build -t serverless-image-optimizer .
docker run --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY serverless-image-optimizer
```

## Notes
- If you have an existing S3 bucket you want to use, add `- existing: true` to the serverless.yml underneath the bucket in s3.

## Roadmap:
1. Move all options from index.js at the top to the serverless.yml env variables.
1. Describe the options in this readme.
1. Write a medium article with instructions.
